**TagPivot**

TagPivot is a lightweight Chrome overlay that helps you see what you’ve been focusing on lately.

It runs entirely on your computer.
No accounts. No cloud. No syncing. No tracking.

⸻

**What it does**

When you open TagPivot on a page, it:
	•	Extracts meaningful tags from the page title and headings
	•	Shows recurring themes across your recent browsing
	•	Highlights “bridges” between topics you visit
	•	Shows “counterpoints” — themes that contrast with your usual patterns
	•	Keeps a small recent history (last 10 captures)

It’s designed to help you notice patterns in how you use the web.

⸻

**How to use**
	•	Open the overlay: Ctrl + Shift + F
	•	Close it: Esc
	•	Click a tag to search it in a new tab
	•	Use “Reset” if you want to clear all local data

That’s it.

⸻

**Privacy**

**TagPivot is local-only.**
	•	Your browsing data stays in your browser.
	•	Nothing is sent to any server.
	•	No login system.
	•	No analytics.
	•	No background syncing.

Anyone using your browser profile can see the overlay data.
If you want to clear it, use Reset.

⸻

**What it is not**
	•	Not a tracking tool
	•	Not a spying tool
	•	Not AI surveillance
	•	Not a content blocker
	•	Not a recommendation engine

It does not try to guess who you are.
It only reflects what you’ve recently visited.

⸻

**Why it exists**

The web is noisy.

TagPivot helps you step back and see structure in your own browsing — what connects, what repeats, what contrasts.

It’s meant to support focus and awareness, not replace search or browsing.
